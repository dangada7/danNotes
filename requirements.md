# Notes Web App â€“ Requirements Document

## 1. Overview
A simple web application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete personal notes. The app should be user-friendly and accessible from any modern web browser.

## 2. Features

### 2.1. User Stories
- As a user, I want to log in using Firebase authentication with Google.
- As a user, I want to create different notes.
- As a user, I want to view a list of all my available notes.
- As a user, I want to view a selected note with a key-value table structure.
- As a user, I want to add a row above or below the selected row in the table.
- As a user, I want to write text in table cells (both key and value columns).
- As a user, I want to edit and delete notes.

### 2.2. Functional Requirements
- Users can log in using Firebase authentication with Google sign-in only.
- Users can create different notes with unique identifiers.
- Users can see a list of all available notes documents.
- Users can select a note to view its details in a key-value table for  mat.
- Users can add new rows to the table above or below any selected row.
- Users can write and edit text directly in table cells (key and value columns).
- Users can delete notes.
- Notes are saved persistently using Firebase.
- The app should have a local caching mechanism that stores notes on the client and can refresh or synchronize data from the server when needed.

### 2.3. Pages Structure
1. **Login Page** - Firebase authentication login interface with Google sign-in only
2. **Notes Page** - Display all available notes documents with navigation options
3. **Note Page** - Display a selected note containing a two-column table (key-value style) with editing capabilities

### 2.3. Non-Functional Requirements
- The app should have a clean, responsive UI.
- The notes table should stretch to fill the full width of the window for better usability and visibility.
- The app should work on desktop and mobile browsers.
- Notes should be saved automatically or with a save button.
- The app should load quickly and be easy to use.


## 3. Technical Requirements
- Frontend: Vue.js framework with HTML and Tailwind CSS for styling
- Backend (optional): Node.js/Express with a simple REST API, or use browser local storage for persistence.
- Data storage: All notes are saved in a table of key and value pairs, where the key is a unique identifier and the value contains the note's data (title, content, etc.). Use Firebase as the primary backend storage solution for notes, enabling real-time synchronization and cloud persistence.
